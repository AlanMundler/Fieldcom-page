This is implementation of a design from a figma Template
[Figma Template Nexcent](https://www.figma.com/file/Yzq14EpRfKfaWyCqIdnPLc/Responsive-Landing-Page-Design-%7C-Website-Home-Page-Design-%7C-Agency-Website-UI-Design-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0-1&t=CM2a2ZZQB9syyWZn-0)

At the time I am making this project, I haven't found any designs for medium-sized (md) and small devices (sm).
So, the responsive design of this template has been completely done by me.

This is a Responsive Webpage of Lessons and Insights using Next.Js and Bootstrap

A website which made using Next.js, Bootstrap resulting in a stunning website.
This project is made completely from Typescript.
